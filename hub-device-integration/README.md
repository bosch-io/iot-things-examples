# Bosch IoT Things - Device integration with Bosch IoT Hub

This example shows how integrate device telemetry data into things of Bosch IoT Things using the device connectivity of Bosch IoT Hub.
It shows how to register things/devices at Things/Hub and how to send data using either HTTP or MQTT.

## Use an existing or request a new Bosch IoT Things service instance

Book the Bosch IoT Things cloud service as described in our [documentation](https://things.eu-1.bosch-iot-suite.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=2_getting_started:booking:start).

## Use an existing or request a new Bosch IoT Hub tenant

Request your own tenant for the Bosch IoT Hub: see [Bosch IoT Hub cloud service](https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com/hub/) for details.

## Configure the integration of these two instances

After you have both instances (Things and Hub) in place, you can setup the integration between the two.
See the [Bosch IoT Thing documentation](things.eu-1.bosch-iot-suite.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=2_getting_started:booking:manage-y-connection) for details.

## Configure your settings

Put your configuration settings and credentials in the file "config.json". You can copy "config.json-template" as template and fill out placeholders.

## Usage

npm run build
npm run start
```

If you need to access the Internet using a proxy configuration, please make sure to set the environment variable HTTPS_PROXY.
